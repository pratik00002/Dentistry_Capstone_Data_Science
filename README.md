The ability to determine the gender of a person using dental metrics has significant applications in forensic medicine, especially in scenarios where the identification of deceased individuals is challenging. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict gender based on dental measurements, providing a reliable method for forensic identification.

2. Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to analyze dental data and develop a predictive model to determine the gender of an individual based on dental features. This involves:

    Collecting and processing raw dental data.
    Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
    Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict gender.

3. Background and Scope

Forensic dentistry is a critical field within forensic medicine, dealing with the examination and evaluation of dental evidence. Dental structures are durable and often remain intact long after other body parts have decayed, making them valuable for identification purposes. By measuring specific dental metrics, it is possible to infer the gender of an individual, aiding in forensic investigations.

4. Data Description

The dataset contains the following features:

    Age: The age of the individual.
    Gender: The gender of the individual (target variable).
    SampleID and SL No.: Unique identifiers for each sample.
    Inter-canine Distance: Measurements related to the distance between canines and other dental features (independent variables).

5. Methodology

5.1 Data Collection
The data is collected from various sources, focusing on dental measurements that are relevant for gender prediction.

5.2 Data Preprocessing

    Missing Value Imputation: Handling missing values to ensure data completeness.
    Data Cleaning: Removing any inconsistencies and errors in the dataset.
    Encoding Categorical Data: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using label encoding.

5.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Analyzing the distribution and correlation of features using visualizations such as heatmaps.
    Identifying any patterns or trends in the data that could inform model development.

5.4 Model Building

    Feature Selection: Dropping irrelevant or highly correlated features.
    Train-Test Split: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
    Model Selection: Using various classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

5.5 Model Evaluation

    Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC curve.
    Selecting the best model based on evaluation results.

6. Results

The performance of each model is assessed and compared. The model with the highest accuracy and best evaluation metrics is chosen as the final model for gender prediction.

7. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the feasibility of using dental metrics to predict gender. The developed model can be applied in forensic scenarios to assist in the identification of deceased individuals, providing a valuable tool for forensic dentists and investigators.
